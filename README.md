# js-url-shortener
Quick JS url shortener using bit.ly API to practice some JavaScript syntax.

### Setup
After cloning the repo, you simply need to set the ```js apiKey``` variable in index.js to your API key registered with bitly.
```js apiKey = "<YOUR_KEY>"```

If you're using VSCode, there's a great extension called 'Live Server', which can be used to deploy a local server for testing front end applications like this. If you have the extension, you can run this application by clicking 'Go Live' on the blue info bar.
